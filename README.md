# OldGameProject # Dead
Something starts in 1999

Game project based over blueprints for (strategic) bookgame. Over the years backstory growned into a world with its own structure laws (both magical and physical) and many more.

September 2016: Temporary stopped due lack of time.

November 2016: Dropped out. Personal skills improved and currently build code looks terrible;

December 2016: Project's world and one of my other worlds merged into new one â€” the world of Saract. Please, check <a href = https://github.com/DivisionCommander/SaraktGame> SaractGame repository</a> for more information.
